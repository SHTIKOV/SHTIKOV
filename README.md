<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Konstantin <img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>

I'm a Software developer living in the Russia, developing mainly in elephant PHP, but I love JS as well as languages too.
I fell in love with the Symfony ecosystem as back-end and VUE as front-end. I also like to study similar technologies.

Feel free to reach me on telegram @shtikov
