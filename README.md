<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm Konstantin <img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="32"/></h1>

I'm Software developer living in the Russia, developping mainly in elephant PHP, but I love JS and other languages too.
I felt in love with the Symfony ecosystem as back-end and VUE as front-end. I also like to study similar technologies.
